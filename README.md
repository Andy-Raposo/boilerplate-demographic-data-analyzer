# Demographic Data Analyzer

This is the repository holding the solution to the second of five freeCodeCamp projects for the Data Analysis with Python certificate, made with VSCode (through GitPod). The solutions can be found in demographic_data_analyzer.py (freeCodeCamp's format) or in the demographic_data_analyzer.ipynb file, using Jupyter Notebooks with a clear UI and commentary. The goals of the project were solved using the instructions given in the following link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer
